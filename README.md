### Brief Notes:
The custom error for my code is CalculatorError. The way I've set it up, no error in Steps 3/4 should go unchecked (instead you should see console logs for each caught error). As before I talked to Evan about this and he approved. Lastly, for the screenshots, please reference the two PNG files in the root of the repository.
